# README for a newly created project.

There are a couple of things you should do first, before you can use all of Mercurial's power:

  * Create new files inside your project
  * Add them to to Mercurial by executing the following command
    `hg add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]
  * Create a commit which can be pushed to a remote host
    `hg commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]
  * Push the commit a remote host
    `hg push [remote URL]` [Enter]

That's it! If this doesn't work for you, please visit the excellent resources from [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide/) and the [Mercurial: The Definitive Guide](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/) book.
If you can't find your answers there, feel free to ask us via Twitter (@cloud9ide), [mailing list](groups.google.com/group/cloud9-ide) or IRC (#cloud9ide on freenode).

Happy coding!
