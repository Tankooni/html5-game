I've put together a super simple game structure to get things going.
I'm trying to make it feel as much like AS3 and C# as possible.

The HTML is super minimal. It's not really HTML5 development. It's Javascript
development. Which sucks, because Javascript is stupid.

I made an Entity class. To see how to make your own classes, look at that file
(entity.js). It's really dumb.

I've put a bunch of comments in all the files, so hopefully it'll explain
everything.

If you don't know how to run the files within this IDE thing, just double-click
the index.html file, and then click "Preview" on the upper toolbar. It should
open a window on the right. In that window, you can just click the refresh
button to see whatever changes you make.

I think "Run" like... compiles it and looks for errors.
